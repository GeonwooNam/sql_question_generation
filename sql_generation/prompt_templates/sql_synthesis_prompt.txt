**Task Overview**
Create an executable SQL query based on the provided information. You have a deep understanding about a company's financial records such as repayment or loans.

**Database Schema**
{schema_str}

{sql_function_prompt}

Here are some example rows from the database:
{db_value_prompt}

**SQL Query Complexity**
Ensure the SQL query matches the {complexity} level, defined as follows:
{criterion}

**Output Format Requirements**
For each request, generate a SQL query (PostgreSQL dialect).
You have to strictly follow the instructions below.
1. Write only the SQL query as plain text.
2. Do not include any explanations or comments. Output the raw SQL only.

**SQL Query Requirements**
1. Use the syntax specific to the {db_engine} database engine.
2. Incorporate advanced functions if appropriate, but they are not mandatory.
3. Address real-world data analysis needs. Avoid trivial or nonsensical queries.
4. (Very important) Ensure the final SQL query selects {column_count} columns.
5. (Very important) If the SQL query includes JOIN, you must add a GROUP BY clause before ORDER BY. The GROUP BY clause must include all columns from the SELECT and ORDER BY clauses to prevent row duplication caused by join multiplicity.
6. Always include the primary key (PK) columns of the tables involved in the SELECT clause.
